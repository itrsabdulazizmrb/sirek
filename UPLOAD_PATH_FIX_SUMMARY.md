# Upload Path Validation Fix Summary

## Problem
The recruitment system was experiencing "Gagal mengunggah gambar: The upload path does not appear to be valid" errors when trying to upload images for assessment questions and other file uploads.

## Root Cause
CodeIgniter's Upload library has strict path validation that requires paths to be resolvable by `realpath()`. The library internally uses `realpath()` in its `validate_upload_path()` method to normalize and validate paths. Using relative paths without proper resolution was causing validation failures.

## Solution
Changed all upload configurations to use `realpath()` for the upload_path configuration, which ensures CodeIgniter's upload library can properly validate and work with the paths.

## Files Modified

### 1. application/controllers/Admin.php
**Assessment Question Image Upload (Add Question):**
- **Before:** `$config['upload_path'] = 'uploads/gambar_soal';`
- **After:** `$config['upload_path'] = realpath($upload_path_full) . '/';`

**Assessment Question Image Upload (Edit Question):**
- **Before:** `$config['upload_path'] = 'uploads/gambar_soal';`
- **After:** `$config['upload_path'] = realpath($upload_path_full) . '/';`

**Profile Picture Upload (Add User):**
- **Before:** `$config['upload_path'] = 'uploads/profile_pictures';`
- **After:** `$config['upload_path'] = realpath($upload_path_full) . '/';`

**Profile Picture Upload (Edit User):**
- **Before:** `$config['upload_path'] = 'uploads/profile_pictures';`
- **After:** `$config['upload_path'] = realpath($upload_path_full) . '/';`

**Blog Image Upload:**
- **Before:** `$config['upload_path'] = './uploads/blog_images/';`
- **After:** `$config['upload_path'] = realpath($upload_path_full) . '/';`

### 2. application/controllers/Pelamar.php
**CV Upload:**
- **Before:** `$config['upload_path'] = 'uploads/cv';`
- **After:** `$config['upload_path'] = realpath($upload_path_full) . '/';`

### 3. application/controllers/Impor.php
**Excel File Upload:**
- **Before:** `$config['upload_path'] = './uploads/temp/';`
- **After:** `$config['upload_path'] = realpath($upload_path_full) . '/';`

## Configuration Pattern

The new standardized pattern for all uploads:

```php
// 1. Define full path for directory operations
$upload_path_full = FCPATH . 'uploads/folder_name/';

// 2. Ensure directory exists
if (!is_dir($upload_path_full)) {
    mkdir($upload_path_full, 0777, true);
}

// 3. Check if directory is writable
if (!is_writable($upload_path_full)) {
    // Handle error
}

// 4. Use realpath for CodeIgniter upload library
$config['upload_path'] = realpath($upload_path_full) . '/';
$config['allowed_types'] = 'file|types';
$config['max_size'] = 4096; // Size in KB
$config['file_name'] = 'prefix_' . time() . '_' . rand(1000, 9999);
```

## Why This Works

1. **realpath() Resolution:** CodeIgniter's Upload library uses `realpath()` internally to validate paths
2. **Absolute Path Compatibility:** The resolved absolute path is compatible with CodeIgniter's validation
3. **Cross-Platform:** Works on both Windows and Unix-like systems
4. **Consistent:** All upload configurations now use the same pattern

## Benefits

1. **Eliminates Upload Errors:** Fixes the "upload path does not appear to be valid" error
2. **Consistent Configuration:** All uploads use the same reliable pattern
3. **Better Error Handling:** Proper directory existence and permission checks
4. **Maintainable:** Standardized approach across the entire codebase

## Testing

All upload functionalities have been tested and verified:
- ✅ Assessment question image uploads
- ✅ Profile picture uploads
- ✅ CV/document uploads
- ✅ Blog image uploads
- ✅ Excel file imports

## Indonesian Naming Convention

The folder structure maintains Indonesian naming conventions:
- `uploads/gambar_soal/` - Question images (previously question_images)
- `uploads/cv/` - CV files
- `uploads/documents/` - Other documents
- `uploads/profile_pictures/` - Profile pictures
- `uploads/blog_images/` - Blog images
- `uploads/temp/` - Temporary files

## Notes

- All existing functionality is preserved
- File permissions are properly checked before upload
- Directory creation is automatic if folders don't exist
- Error handling provides clear feedback to users
- The fix is backward compatible with existing uploaded files
